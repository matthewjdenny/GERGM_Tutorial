\Abstract{
\noindent The \pkg{GERGM} package is an implementation of the generalized exponential random graph model (GERGM), including methods for estimation and simulation using Gibbs sampling and Metropolis Hastings. Here, we illustrate the generalized exponential random graph model and its implementation in \pkg{GERGM} using data on financial flows between OECD counties, and migration flows between U.S. states.
